Renayre Forbes (B00787109) Assumptions (A4) 
CSCI 2170 - March 21 2019 

Error Message: 
"Error, please try logging in"
	- I picked the message because I felt it was generic enough to be used in different circumstances. (When an unlogged in user clicks 'The Force' or if they have attempted before)
	- I made the text a little bigger, bolded and colored the text red. I placed it right above the username field so it is in a central location and adds to the readability. 

I changed the order of the user emails and passwords in users.csv to match with the order of my table columns.
